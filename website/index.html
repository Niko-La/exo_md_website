      <h2>Exo Labs</h2>

        <b>The benefits of AI should be shared by everyone.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A few companies build, deploy and control the most capable AI models.
      </p>
      <p>
        These companies are abusing the reasonable premise of AI safety in order to push for anti-competitive regulations like SB 1047 that secure their oligopoly.
        These companies are deploying capital at unprecedented scale. The largest known AI training clusters being built today are $150B+.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without immediate and decisive action, the benefits of AI will be concentrated in the hands of a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mission of Exo Labs is to subvert this tragedy. To build a future where AI is owned by everyone, not just a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exo Labs builds software that restores the balance of power to individuals using cryptography, anonymous technologies, digital signatures, and with electronic money.
        The first step in this mission is an <a href="https://github.com/exo-explore/exo">open-source library</a> that enables anyone to run large AI models on consumer devices.
